# Plant-Disease-Detection-System-for-Sustainable-Agriculture

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-based solution for detecting plant diseases using computer vision and machine learning. It leverages deep learning techniques to identify common plant diseases from images of plant leaves. The goal is to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in early disease detection to improve crop yield and reduce pesticide usage.

## Features
- **Disease Detection**: Detects various plant diseases based on leaf images.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Provides quick diagnosis using pre-trained models for plant diseases.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: The system can be used in mobile applications for easy access in field conditions.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Suggests preventive measures based on detected diseases.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing machine learning and data processing.
- **Keras**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and manipulation.

## Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset containing labeled images of various plant diseases. You can explore the dataset used in the project here:
